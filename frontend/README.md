# Frontend (React + TypeScript)

## Prerequisites
* Node.js 18+
* npm 9+

## Development (Hot Reload)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install        # first time only
npm run dev        # starts Vite dev server on http://localhost:5173 with HMR
```

API requests to `/api` paths are proxied to the Spring Boot backend running on `http://localhost:8080` (see `vite.config.ts`).

## Production Build
```bash
npm run build
```
This compiles the app and outputs static files into `../backend/src/main/resources/static`. When the Spring Boot application is running, visiting `http://localhost:8080/` will serve `index.html` generated by this build.

You can preview the production build locally using:
```bash
npm run preview
```
